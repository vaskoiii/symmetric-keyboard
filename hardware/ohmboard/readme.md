# ohmboard: the vaskos diy keyboard
the hardware version and dir are completely separate from the php and js implementation. they share the same repo because they are both different attempts to implement the same design.

if wanting to make the hardware version of this keyboard with increased functionality, instructions are at:

# setup
once the hardware keyboard is all setup, use teensyduino to compile and upload the firmware.
